# TankFight

## Overview

TankFight is a small game developed using the Godot Engine. This game is to test my ability to code a small game.

## Gameplay

In TankFight, players control a tank using the WASD or arrow keys for movement and the left mouse button to fire.
The objective is simple: eliminate the enemy tank while avoiding incoming fire.
